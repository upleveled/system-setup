   ```

   This installs some VS Code extensions we will need.<br><br>

10. We recommend installing and using Chrome so that you have the same DevTools as others.<br><br>
    If you don't have Chrome installed yet, you can install it with Homebrew. To do this, copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.<br><br>
    ```bash
    brew install --cask google-chrome
    ```
    This uses Homebrew to install Chrome.<br><br>
11. Install the following Chrome Extensions:
    - [React Developer tools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
    - [Refined GitHub Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf?hl=en)
    - [Socket Security Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/socket-security/jbcobpbfgkhmjfpjjepkcocalmpkiaop?hl=en)
    - [Web Vitals Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-vitals/ahfhijdlegdabablpippeagghigmibma?hl=en))
12. Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.<br><br>

    ```bash
    pnpm create @upleveled/react-app --help
    ```

    This step will prepare a program that we will use in the course. This will take a while and then respond with a message with some usage instructions, similar to this:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-cra-installed.avif"><br><br>

13. Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.<br><br>
    ```bash
    pnpm add --global @upleveled/preflight
    ```
    This will prepare a program that we will use in the course.<br><br>
14. <a name="vs-code-settings"></a> Next we will configure VS Code.<br><br>
    Open VS Code and then press the keys <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd>. Type in "Settings" and select the item that says `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-vscode-settings.png"><br><br>
    Once the settings file is open, we will want to add the settings below.<br><br>
    First of all, identify whether your settings file is empty or not. This is what an empty file looks like:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-vscode-settings-empty.png"><br><br>
    If your file is **not empty** (if there is more text within the curly brackets), then **we will need to do something extra** - add a comma on the second to last line:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-vscode-settings-comma.png"><br><br>
    Now in both cases you will want to paste the following settings **before the closing curly bracket (before the `}`)**:<br><br>
    ```json5
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "editor.linkedEditing": true,
    "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": [
      // Sort package.json keys with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unional.vscode-sort-package-json
      "source.sortPackageJson"
    ],
    "tsImportSorter.configuration.groupRules": ["^node:", {}, "^[.]"],
    "tsImportSorter.configuration.keepUnused": [".*"],
    "tsImportSorter.configuration.emptyLinesBetweenGroups": 0,
    "tsImportSorter.configuration.wrappingStyle": "prettier",
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "[html]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[javascript]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[javascriptreact]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[typescript]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[typescriptreact]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[json]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[jsonc]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "explorer.openEditors.visible": 0,
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
    "files.trimFinalNewlines": true,
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
    "[markdown]": {
      "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": false
    },
    "workbench.editor.tabSizing": "shrink",
    "workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups": false,
    "prettier.singleQuote": true,
    "prettier.trailingComma": "all",
    "eslint.runtime": "node",
    ```
    After you have pasted the settings, save the file with `File` -> `Save` in the top menu.<br><br>
    If you had any previous settings beforehand, you may notice that some text above will be underlined by a squiggly yellow line. This is a warning because we pasted some duplicate properties from the code above.<br><br>
    If you have any of these warnings, we should fix them. For each one of these lines with the warnings on them, delete the full line, including the comma at the end. We usually like to select from the start of the first `"` to just before the next `"` on the next line:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-vscode-settings-fix-warnings.png"><br><br>
    If you made any further changes to the file, save the file again with `File` -> `Save` in the top menu.<br><br>
15. <a name="postgresql"></a>We will now install PostgreSQL. Copy each line in the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.

    ```bash
    brew install postgresql@15
    brew link postgresql@15
    ```

    This uses Homebrew to install PostgreSQL and create just a single user with your username and all role permissions. There will be no `postgres` user set up.<br><br>
    Now let's set an environment variable to tell PostgreSQL where to put the data:

    ```bash
    [[ -d /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15 ]] && PGDATA_TMP=/opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15 || PGDATA_TMP=/usr/local/var/postgresql@15
    echo "\nexport PGDATA=$PGDATA_TMP\nexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/`[[ $SHELL == *"zsh" ]] && echo '.zshrc' || echo '.bash_profile'`
    source ~/`[[ $SHELL == *"zsh" ]] && echo '.zshrc' || echo '.bash_profile'`
    ```

    We can now test whether PostgreSQL has been correctly installed by starting the database. To do this, we can run the following command:

    ```bash
    postgres
    ```

    If it worked, it should print out some lines with some messages and end with the rectangular cursor on the left side of the screen:

    <img src="./macos-5-postgres.png"><br><br>

    The messages may be different than the messages in the image above, and may not mention that PostgreSQL is ready to accept connections:

    <img src="./windows-5-postgres.jpg"><br><br>

    You will need to run this every time you want to use your database.<br><br>
    When you want to stop PostgreSQL again, just stop it like any other command line program using the shortcut <kbd>control</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

    Now we will connect to PostgreSQL using a tool called `psql` and add a new table, to make sure everything is working with the connection.

    Open a new tab in the terminal using <kbd>command</kbd>-<kbd>T</kbd> and run the following command:

    ```bash
    psql postgres
    ```

    It should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.1-psql.png"><br><br>

    If your screen looks like the above screenshot, type in or copy and paste the following query (this is a language called SQL):

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users(
      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
      last_name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

    It should print `CREATE TABLE` on the line after running the query. Your screen should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.2-psql.png"><br><br>

    Now let's check that the table has been created. Run this query:

    ```
    \dt
    ```

    This will show the tables that you have, including the newly-created `users` table. Your screen should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.3-psql.png"><br><br>

    Finally, let's delete the table again to clean up. Run this query:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE users;
    ```

    It should print `DROP TABLE` on the line after running the query. Your screen should look like this:<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.4-psql.png"><br><br>

    Great, PostgreSQL is set up! 🚀 Now you can exit from `psql` again by writing `exit` and hitting return:

    ```
    exit
    ```

    It should exit and send you back to the command line. Your screen should look similar to this (the last line will not be exactly the same):<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.5-psql.png"><br><br>

    Now close the new terminal tab with <kbd>command</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd>, and stop PostgreSQL again using <kbd>control</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>. PostgreSQL should shut down - your screen should look similar to this (the last line will not be exactly the same):<br><br>

    <img src="./macos-5.6-psql.png"><br><br>

16. <a name="docker"></a>We will now install Docker. Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask docker
    open /Applications/Docker.app
    ```

    This uses Homebrew Cask to install Docker for Mac and starts it for the first time to set it up. Wait for a message at the top of the window to indicate that everything is finished being set up:<br><br>
    <img src="./macos-6-docker.png"><br><br>

17. Test if Docker is installed by running the following command on the command line:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    It should print out a welcome message like this:<br><br>
    <img src="macos-6-docker-hello-world.png"><br><br>

18. <a name="expo-react-native"></a>We will now install Expo CLI for React Native.

    Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.

    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

    You can ignore the lines marked `WARN` - these do not indicate problems:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-expo-init.png"><br><br>

    Lastly, we'll install Expo on your phone, so that you can also test on a real device.

    On your phone, go to the app store and install Expo on your phone ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)). Create an account and log in.

19. Next we will set up some dependencies for Expo and React Native.

    Copy each line in the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask android-studio
    [ -d "$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" ] && ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk || ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/Android/Sdk
    echo "export ANDROID_SDK=$ANDROID_SDK" >> ~/`[[ $SHELL == *"zsh" ]] && echo '.zshenv' || echo '.bash_profile'`
    echo "export PATH=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:\$PATH" >> ~/`[[ $SHELL == *"zsh" ]] && echo '.zshenv' || echo '.bash_profile'`
    source ~/`[[ $SHELL == *"zsh" ]] && echo '.zshenv' || echo '.bash_profile'`
    ```

    This will install Android Studio, for creating and running Android virtual devices in an emulator.

    Open Android Studio using the Spotlight or locating it in Applications.

    If it asks to import Android Studio Settings, choose **Do not import settings**.

    When prompted, choose a **Custom** install:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-setup-install-type-custom.png"><br><br>

    Leave the default JDK installation location as-is and click **Next**:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-setup-jdk-location.png"><br><br>

    Uncheck the box next to **Android Virtual Device** (we will install our own manually):<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-setup-uncheck-virtual-device.png"><br><br>

    For each of the licenses with red stars next to them, click on the license name and then accept the agreement, finally clicking on **Finish** when you have accepted all agreements:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-setup-license-agreement.png"><br><br>

    This will download components, which may take a few minutes:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-setup-downloading-components.png"><br><br>

    Next will be getting a virtual device installed. Click on **More Actions** and select **Virtual Device Manager**:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-virtual-device-dropdown.png"><br><br>

    Click on the **Create device** button on the top left of the window:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-virtual-device-create-device.png"><br><br>

    Select the Pixel 3a as the hardware device.

    Under the **Recommended** tab (the default tab), locate the system image named **R** (API level 30) and click on the **Download** link next to it. In the window that pops up, accept the license agreement and click **Next**:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-virtual-device-system-image-download.png"><br><br>

    Once the download completes, select the image you just downloaded and click on **Next** through the rest of the steps until the virtual device has been created:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-virtual-device-system-image-select.png"><br><br>

    The device will now show up in the Device Manager. Click on the triangular play button to launch the virtual device in the emulator. An emulator window will appear showing the screen of the virtual device:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-virtual-device-launch.png"><br><br>

    If a message pops up in the virtual device that the "System UI isn't responding" at any point during these steps, you can click on "Wait".

    Before running the first Expo app, test that the Android Studio `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) program has been set up properly, by running the following in a new Terminal (open a new tab):

    ```bash
    adb
    ```

    It should print the version and help information:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-android-studio-adb.png"><br><br>

20. To verify that Expo is working with the Android Studio virtual device copy and run each of these lines separately in the terminal:

    <!-- TODO: Check if we can remove the `echo ...` and `pnpm install ...` steps below when Expo supports RN 0.72 with symlinks https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/issues/28 -->

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mkdir -p projects
    cd projects
    pnpm create expo@latest expo-test --template blank
    cd expo-test
    echo 'node-linker=hoisted' > ./.npmrc
    pnpm install --force
    pnpm start --android
    ```

    This will create a new Expo demo app and start it.

    If this step doesn't work, it's possible that you may not have the emulator running - check the last part of the previous step to see how to launch the emulator.

    The first thing that you will see is the installation of Expo Go on the virtual device:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-expo-start-expo-go-install.png"><br><br>

    Next, the Metro bundler will bundle the JavaScript for the device, which may take some time. You will see a loading bar in the command line and a loading screen on the virtual device:<br><br>

    <img src="./general-expo-start-metro-bundling-cli.png"><br><br>

    <img src="./general-expo-start-metro-bundling-emulator.png"><br><br>

    After the bundling has completed, the simple app should show up in the virtual device, with the words "Open up App.js to start working on your app!":<br><br>

    <img src="./general-expo-start-app-loaded.png"><br><br>

    Click on the small `x` at the top right of the virtual device frame to stop the virtual device - this will save a snapshot to make starting the virtual device faster in the future.

21. If you don't have one yet, create a Google account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup?hl=en). Make a note of the email address associated with this account for usage in later steps.
22. If you don't have one yet, create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join). Make sure to set a name.

    If you already have a GitHub account and you haven't set a name on GitHub yet, go to the [GitHub Profile Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and add a name:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-github-profile-settings.png"><br><br>
    We will use this name in the next step.<br><br>

23. For this step, we'll need to **edit some of the information in the commands** by adding our own information.<br><br>
    First of all, we will set our name, which will be the same name as on our GitHub profile:<br><br>
    <img src="./general-github-name.png"><br><br>
    Copy your name from your profile, **add it in quotes** in the command (replace `Mona Lisa Octocat`) and run the command:<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa Octocat"
    ```
    You can test whether the name was set correctly with the next command (if it worked, it will print the name on the next line):<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name
    ```
    <br>For running the next command, **add your email in quotes**:<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "monalisaoctocat@example.com"
    ```
    You can test whether the email was set correctly with with the next command (if it worked, it will print the email on the next line):<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email
    ```
    This prepares `git` so that your work is attributed correctly to you.<br><br>

<!-- 23. Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
    ```
    This step will save your GitHub password so that you don't need to enter it every time.<br><br> -->

23. Copy the following text, paste it in the terminal and hit return.<br><br>
    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```
    This step will change the default Git branch from `master` to `main` (see https://github.com/github/renaming).<br><br>
24. Go back to GitHub, and go to your profile page by clicking on your avatar at the top right and selecting **Your profile**<br><br>
    <img src="./general-github-your-profile.png"><br><br>
    Copy the `github.com/...` URL in the address bar of your browser, for use in the next step.
25. Click on Applications in the dock and start Slack. Log in to the UpLeveled Slack. Send your GitHub profile URL to [Kimberley](https://upleveled.slack.com/team/U02NSD2E3P1). Also send your Google Account email address to Kimberley (if you haven't already).
26. <a name="specs"></a>Click on the apple icon in the menu bar at the top left of your screen and select "About This Mac". Select "System Report...". Copy the "Hardware Overview" information in the right panel and send to Kimberley. Select "Software" in the left panel, copy the "System Software Overview" information and send to Kimberley.
27. On your phone, go to the app store and install Slack on your phone. Log in to the UpLeveled Slack.
